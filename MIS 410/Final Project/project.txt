Perfect, let’s lay this out so you and your team know **exactly** what’s happening and what needs to get done.

---

## 1. Big Picture – What We’re Building

**Project:** CSUSM Club & Event Hub (“CougarConnect”)
**Goal:** Central place for students to **find events & clubs** and **RSVP**, and for club officers to **create/manage events**.
**Tech:** Flask, Jinja, WTForms, SQLAlchemy, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Auth (register/login/logout) 

Your app must:

* Solve a real user problem
* Have **CRUD for at least two entities** (Clubs, Events, RSVPs)
* Use **WTForms with validation**
* Have **authentication + protected routes**
* Be **responsive** and reasonably clean code 

---

## 2. Phase 0 – Team Alignment (Now)

**You already:**

* Picked the idea ✅
* Wrote the 150–200 word pitch ✅

**Next:**

* Decide rough **roles** (everyone still codes, but has focus):

  * **Backend/Auth lead** – user model, login, register, sessions
  * **Database/Models lead** – tables & relationships
  * **Frontend/UI lead** – Bootstrap, layout, styling
  * **PM/Docs lead** – keeps track of tasks, presentation, and report

---

## 3. Phase 1 – Requirements & Design

### a) Define user roles

* **Student (default user):**

  * Browse clubs
  * Browse events
  * RSVP / cancel RSVP
  * See “My Events” dashboard
* **Club officer:**

  * Same as student
  * PLUS: create/update/delete **their** club(s) and events
* (Optional) **Admin:** manage all clubs/events

### b) Core user stories

Examples (you can reuse in report/presentation):

* “As a student, I can browse upcoming events and RSVP so I don’t miss opportunities.”
* “As a club officer, I can create an event and see RSVPs so I can plan space/snacks.” 

### c) ERD / Database Design (minimum)

Tables we’ll likely use:

* **User**

  * id, name, email, password_hash, role (student/officer/admin)
* **Club**

  * id, name, description, category, created_by (FK → User)
* **Event**

  * id, club_id (FK → Club), title, description, date_time, location, capacity (optional)
* **RSVP**

  * id, user_id (FK → User), event_id (FK → Event), timestamp

(Optional but nice):

* **ClubMembership** (user_id, club_id, role_in_club)

### d) Wireframes (quick sketch)

* Home page – list of upcoming events (sorted by date).
* Event detail page – info + RSVP button.
* Clubs page – list of clubs.
* Club detail – club info + future events.
* “My Events” – list events the user RSVP’d to.
* Auth pages – login/register.

---

## 4. Phase 2 – Project Setup (Code Skeleton)

1. Create **Git repo** & base Flask project:

   * `app/__init__.py` (app factory)
   * `app/models.py`
   * `app/routes.py` or Blueprints (`auth`, `main`, `clubs`, `events`)
   * `config.py` (using env variables) 

2. Set up:

   * Virtual environment
   * Install packages: Flask, Flask-WTF, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate, Flask-Bootstrap (or just CDN), SQLAlchemy, etc.
   * Base layout template: `base.html` with navbar + Bootstrap.

3. Connect database:

   * Use SQLite for dev.
   * Add `User`, `Club`, `Event`, `RSVP` models.
   * Run migrations.

---

## 5. Phase 3 – Implement Core Features (Build Order)

### Step 1 – Authentication

* Register form (WTForms): name, email, password, confirm password, role (maybe hidden or default student).
* Login form + session management (Flask-Login).
* Logout route.
* Protect routes like “create event”, “create club”.

### Step 2 – Club CRUD

* Routes:

  * List all clubs (`/clubs`)
  * View a club (`/clubs/<id>`)
  * Create club (officer only)
  * Edit club (creator only)
  * Delete club (creator/admin only)
* WTForms for club create/edit with validation.

### Step 3 – Event CRUD

* Routes:

  * List events (homepage `/`)
  * View event (`/events/<id>`)
  * Create event (club officer, tied to a club)
  * Edit event (creator only)
  * Delete event
* Sort events by date (upcoming first).
* Form validation for date/time, required fields.

### Step 4 – RSVP System

* `RSVP` table (user_id + event_id).
* Routes:

  * “RSVP” → create RSVP record.
  * “Cancel RSVP” → delete RSVP record.
  * Event page shows count of attendees (and list, if you want).

### Step 5 – Dashboards / Views

* **Home page:** upcoming events (sorted).
* **My Events:** show events where `RSVP.user_id == current_user.id`.
* (Optional) My Clubs: clubs user owns or belongs to.

---

## 6. Phase 4 – UI & Responsiveness

* Use **Bootstrap**:

  * Navbar with links: Home, Events, Clubs, My Events, Login/Logout.
  * Cards for events and clubs.
  * Make sure it looks good on mobile (stacked columns, no horizontal scroll).
* Add basic **error messages** and **flash messages** (e.g., “Event created”, “Login failed”).

---

## 7. Phase 5 – Testing & Cleanup

* Walk through all user flows as:

  * New student user (register → browse → RSVP → My Events).
  * Club officer (register → create club → create event → view RSVPs).
* Fix bugs:

  * Broken links
  * Validation errors
  * Unauthorized access (e.g., student trying to edit event they don’t own).
* Make sure:

  * No secrets (keys, passwords) are hard-coded. Use env variables. 

---

## 8. Phase 6 – Presentation Prep

From the guideline: 8–10 min, with problem framing, live demo, behind-the-scenes, reflection. 

Create a simple plan:

1. **Intro & Problem (1–2 min)** – “Events are scattered… here’s who we help.”
2. **Live Demo (4–5 min)** – show:

   * Register/login
   * Browse events
   * RSVP
   * Officer creating a club + event
3. **Technical Deep Dive (2–3 min)** – models, routes, auth, WTForms.
4. **Reflection (1–2 min)** – what went well, what was hard, what you’d add next.

---

## 9. Phase 7 – Written Report Tasks

Use their sections as checklist: 

1. **Overview** – What CougarConnect is, who uses it, why it matters.
2. **Problem & Users** – Describe CSUSM event chaos + how you measure success (students find/join events).
3. **Implementation Details** – Forms, validation, auth, main models, libraries.
4. **Results & Demo Scenarios** – Describe user flows (like your demo script).
5. **Challenges & Solutions** – Bugs, design issues, auth problems, etc.
6. **Team Contributions** – 1 paragraph: who did what.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Turn this into a **task list by person**
* Or sketch the **actual models.py** + rough route structure so you’re ready to start coding in VS Code.
